        <p>Since the first detection of Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in groundwater in 2013 by the City of Fountain, our understanding of the source and distribution of these constituents in the environment has been biased toward those parties proactive in their investigations.  Change to - Since the first detection of Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in groundwater, our understanding of the source and distribution of these constituents in the environment has been biased toward those parties proactive in their investigations. </p>

        <p>We only see PFOS/PFOA where we have sampled. And we have only sampled in select locations.</p>

        <p>Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA) facilities in El Paso County subject to Corrective Action will be sampling for PFOS/PFOA in the future and will help expand the understanding of the area.</p>
