        <br/>
        <p>Colorado Springs, CO was founded in 1858 as a resort town built along the largest flowing water source on the Front Range, Fountain Creek.</p>

        <p>Growth of the area was dominated by mining in the late 1800s, military establishment during WWII, and manufacturing expansion during the 1970s.</p>

        <p>Numerous US Air Force and US Army installations are present in the area, with Fort Carson being the largest military installation in the state.</p>

        <p>Much of the manufacturing growth during the 1970s-1990s was due to an influx of electronics companies ranging from semiconductor to computer manufacturers.</p>
