      <p>The patterns of PFAS analytes and the distribution of PFAS concentrations tell a lot about potential sources.</p>

      <p>All Level IV data packages available through June 2019 were mined for PFAS data and chromatography. A literature review for diagnostic rations/PFAS patterns, weathering patterns, and isomer distribution were completed.</p>

      <p>Principal component analysis (PCA) of the dataset was completed to determine drivers of variability. PCA identifies and graphically shows the most important features of data that describe similarities and differences between sample chemistries within a dataset.</p>
