        <br/>
        <p>Development centered along Fountain Creek makes the watershed susceptible to industrial and military impact.</p>

        <p>Many industrial sources, such as semiconductor and  computer manufacturing, coatings applications, and metal plating shops, as well as, landfills, wastewater treatment (WWT) plants, and firefighting operations are potential sources of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the environment.</p>

        <p>Releases from these sources can be spread in groundwater through the use of irrigation, dust suppression, quarry dewatering, stormwater runoff, biosolids piping, and natural surface water flow and subsurface hydrogeologic processes.</p>
