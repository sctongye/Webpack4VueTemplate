        <h2>Beijing</h2>
        <p>
            Beijing, Jing for short, is a metropolis in northern China and the capital of China. Lying 70 mi (102 km)
            west of Bohai Sea, it borders Hebei Province to the north, west, south, and for a small section in the east
            and Tianjin to the southeast. This city
            is a major transportation hub, with dozens of railways, roads and motorways passing through the city. It is
            also the destination of many international flights arriving in China. It is regarded as the political,
            educational, and
            cultural center of China.

            With a history of more than 3,000 years, it has been an integral part of China's history. There is scarcely
            a major building that doesn't have at least some national historical significance. Being the capital of
            China for about 850 years, it is one of
            the Four Great Ancient Capitals of China, offering China's most wonderful array of attractions. No other
            city in the nation attracts more travelers.

            Seven hundred yeas ago, amazed by his unbelievable description of China, people asked Marco Polo whether his
            stories were true. He answered: What I have told you was not even half of what I saw. Actually, what was
            mentioned above is only a fraction of
            this city that awaits visitors from all over the world.
